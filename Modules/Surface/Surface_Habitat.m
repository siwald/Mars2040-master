%----------------------Code Definition-----------------------------------
%Surface Habitat is solving for the Mass, Volume, and power required to
%sustain the lifes of 20 people on Mars. The values in this module are
%based off previous studies. The initial volume is a combination of the
%Marsone study and the BVAD document from NASA. 

%------Inputs------

% Percentage of food supply grown on Mars
% Cur_Arch{1} = 'FIXED_SHELL';
% Cur_Arch{2} = 'INFLATABLE';
% Cur_Arch{3} = 0.5;
% Cur_Arch{4} = 0.5;

%------Outputs------

%This module will output the SWAP values for the surface architecture. This
%modules includes the radiation protection and habitat structure. The food,
%parts, etc requirements are included in the other modules.

%Surf_Volume;

%------Constants------

%resources. These values can be changed once further information becomes
%available on the actual usage that is seen.

Crew_Size = Cur_Arch.SurfaceCrew.Size; %Units: Crew Members; Mission Decision
BVAD.Facilities = 185.13; %Units: m^3; There are 5 facilities in BVAD design with 4 astronauts. For our study we still would use 5 facilities but multiply this value by 5 to account for 20 astronauts instead of 4. 
BVAD.Tunnel = 263.43; %Units: m^3; The tunnel will not be affected by the increase in astronauts. 
BVAD.Airlock = 48; %Units: m^3; The airlock will not be affected by the increase in astronauts.

Marineris.Kitchen = 132.444; %Units: m^3/5 CM; This is based off the size of a large kitchen + pantry + eat area. This is for a typical household therefore these values will be based off approximately 5 people (typical large family)
